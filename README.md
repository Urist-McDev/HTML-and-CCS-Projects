# Major Projects

### One Page Website

The one page website was a project to make a travel planner website. I created one showcasing the ficitional world of Roshar, from The Stormlight Archive book series by Brandon Sanderson.
It makes use of image overlays, navbars, a video player, and a fake contact form.

### Bootstrap site

I made use of the Bootstrap framework for the other major site I created. The promt was to making a movie theater site, but I changed that to a super villain showroom.
It makes use of bootstrap navbars, jumbotron, cards, and column layouts.
